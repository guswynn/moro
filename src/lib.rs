/// The scope is not considered to be complete until all jobs

/// can refer to stack variables that are defined outside
/// the scope.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
/// let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 5];
/// let scope = moro::async_scope!(|scope| {
///     let job = scope.spawn(async {
///         let r: i32 = v.iter().sum();
///         r
///     });
///     job.await * 2
/// }).infallible();
/// let result = scope.await;
/// assert_eq!(result, 22);
/// # });
/// ```
///
/// For more examples, see the [examples] directory in the
/// repository.
///
/// [examples]: https://github.com/nikomatsakis/structtastic/tree/main/examples
///
/// # Access to stack variables
///
/// Futures spawned inside an async scope can refer to
/// stack variables defined outside the scope:
///
/// ```rust
/// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
/// let r = 22;
/// let scope = moro::async_scope!(|scope| {
///     // OK to refer to `r` here
///     scope.spawn(async { r }).await
/// }).infallible();
/// let result = scope.await;
/// assert_eq!(result, 22);
/// # });
/// ```
///
/// but when you spawn a future, that future cannot refer to
/// stack variables defined *inside* the scope (except its own
/// variables, of course):
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail,E0373
/// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
/// let scope = moro::async_scope!(|scope| {
///     let r = 22;
//
///     // NOT ok to refer to `r` now, because `r`
///     // is defined inside the scope
///     scope.spawn(async { r }).await
/// }).infallible();
/// let result = scope.await;
/// assert_eq!(result, 22);
/// # });
/// ```
